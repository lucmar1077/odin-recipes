This project is a recipe browser that contains a list of 
meals linking to their recipes.

Unfortunately, my understanding on placing elements with CSS is very limited, so the website is very unresponsive (view it in fullscreen to get the intended experience). Once I learn flexbox (or maybe once I learn grid?) and get better at using the correct units, I'll either revert this project to an older version or start a fresh repository called odin-projects-2.0 or something.
