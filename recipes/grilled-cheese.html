            <ul>
                <li>4 cups chopped fresh tomatoes</li>
                <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
                <li>1 large slice of onion</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons white sugar, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Tomato Soup Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Combine tomatoes, chicken broth, garlic cloves, and a large slice of onion in a stockpot over medium heat. Bring to a boil, and gently simmer for about 20 minutes to blend flavors. </li>
                <li> Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl, or pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food mill. </li>
                <li> Melt butter over medium heat in the now empty stockpot. Stir in flour to make a roux by cooking, whisking constantly, until mixture turns medium brown. </li>
                <li> Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture to prevent lumps from forming, then stir in the rest. </li>
                <li> Season with sugar and salt to taste. </li>
                <li> Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
