                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
                <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
                <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
                <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
                <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
                <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>
